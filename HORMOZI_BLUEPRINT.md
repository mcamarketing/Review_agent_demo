## Phase 1: Value Equation Fixes (Week 1)

### Current State (5.5/10)
- Dream Outcome: 6/10 (buried)
- Likelihood: 4/10 (no social proof)
- Time Delay: 8/10 (48hrs is excellent)
- Effort/Sacrifice: 9/10 (performance pricing)

### Target State (9/10)
- Dream Outcome: 9/10 - Lead with £10K-£50K
- Likelihood: 8/10 - Founder authority + methodology
- Time Delay: 9/10 - Emphasize 48hr + 30-90 day recovery
- Effort/Sacrifice: 10/10 - Zero-risk pricing

---

## Phase 2: Hero & Messaging (This Week)

### New Hero Copy
```
HEADLINE: Your CRM Is Hiding £10,000-£50,000 in Ready-to-Close Revenue

SUBHEADLINE: We'll prove it in 48 hours — and you only pay when we recover money.
```

### Supporting Copy
1. **Quantify the problem**: 400-2,000 leads × £50-£500 = £20K-£100K sitting in your database
2. **Establish authority**: 10+ years, 1,000+ pipeline audits
3. **Triple risk reversal**: No setup, no monthly fees, no risk

### Primary CTA
- Button: "Get Your Free Revenue Leak Audit"
- Above: "See exactly how much revenue is hiding in your CRM — in 48 hours"
- Below: "5 spots available this week • No credit card • 48-hour delivery"

### Secondary CTA
- Button: "See How We Found £47K for One Client"
- Sub: "Watch 3-minute case study walkthrough"

## Phase 3: Pricing Tiers (This Week)

### Tier 1: Ghost Lead Recovery Engine (LEAD WITH THIS)
- **Structure**: Hybrid Performance-Based
- **Processing Fee**: £0.10 per lead analyzed
- **Revenue Share**: 10% of recovered revenue
- **Volume Discounts**:
  - 0-500 leads: £0.10 each
  - 501-2,000: £0.08 each
  - 2,001+: £0.05 each
- **Guarantee**: 3x ROI or refund processing fee within 90 days

---

## Phase 4: Demo Flow (This Month)

### Current Problem
- Shows SMS demo BEFORE value reveal = 30-50% abandonment
- No "aha moment"

### Optimized Flow
```
Step 1: Form (3 fields: Name, Phone, Company)
         ↓
Step 2: THANK YOU PAGE = Ghost Lead Calculator Reveal
         "You have 847 ghost leads = £28,400 in ready-to-close revenue"
         ↓
Step 3: SMS Demo (OPTIONAL) - "We just sent you an SMS..."
         ↓
Step 4: Post-demo CTA - Connect tactical demo to strategic value
```

### Key Changes
1. Calculator reveal FIRST (aha moment)
2. SMS demo OPTIONAL (not gate)
3. Skip option at every step

---

## Phase 5: Authority & Social Proof (This Week)

### Remove Immediately
- ❌ Fake 4.8/5 (127 reviews) - destroys trust

### Replace With
- ✅ "Currently Working With 5 Beta Partners"
- ✅ "£4.2M+ Ghost Lead Revenue Identified"
- ✅ "10+ Years Pipeline Forensics Experience"
- ✅ "48-Hour Audit Turnaround Guaranteed"

### Founder Authority Block
```
HEADLINE: Built by Someone Who's Done This 1,000+ Times

BODY: I'm [Name], 10+ years recovering revenue from stale pipelines.
I've personally identified over £4.2M in ghost lead revenue.
This isn't AI hype — it's sales forensics automated.
```

---

## Phase 6: Category Positioning (This Month)

### Current Category
Review Management Platforms (commodity, saturated)

### Desired Category
Revenue Leak Detection & Recovery (blue ocean)

### Own the Language
- "Ghost Lead Syndrome"
- "Revenue Leak Audit"
- "CRM Forensics"
- "Ready-to-Close Revenue"

### Content Ideas
1. "The £47K Hiding in Your CRM" - Case study
2. "State of Revenue Leakage 2025" - Benchmark report
3. "7 Signs Your CRM Is Costing You Revenue" - Checklist
